In the United States, while many families start out at the same income level, not all have the same futures. A data set originally published by OppInsightsortunity  shows that white citizens starting at the 25th percentile income rank could rise to a higher rank than their black or hispanic counterparts. Furthermore, this upward mobility was more likely in both northern and urban regions.

## Race and Gender
Given a family with a household income at the 25 percentile nationally, the data provides the mean income rank per county that a child of that family could expect to achieve in adulthood. Additionally, information was gathered about the characteristics of each county (such as mean commute time or cost of living). Although all those pooled may have started in the same income rank during childhood, as adults the pooled achieved vastly different levels of upward mobility. White respondents were much more likely to achieve a higher income rank. Moreover, as you can see from the app below, differing neighborhood characteristics had little effect on the gap between white and black/hispanic achievement.

## Geography
For all families across race and gender lines, geography played a significant role in determining levels of upward mobility. As a whole, those pooled in Southern regions experienced relatively little upward mobility with many counties such as Northwest Arctic Borough, AK showing an average income rank of 24%. Those pooled in the Midwest faced the highest levels of upward mobility with Harding County, SD as high as 68%.
